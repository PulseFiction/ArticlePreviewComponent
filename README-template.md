## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery



### What I learned

Started with Javascript to initially manipulated the DOM, however after learning jQuery I found it much easier to use that syntax to build a simple share button that toggles on and off.

### Continued development

Still want to improve with best practices when it comes to CSS design. Feel like there's definitely easier ways to produce what I made but haven't figured out yet.


### Useful resources

Used Sololearn to learn jQuery.
